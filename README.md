# Ukraine_NTL_Analysis
An analysis of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine using NASA VNP46A2 data. Completed for my masters dissertation in Satellite Data Science at the University of Leicester.

This code was produced for my thesis project and is not designed to be a stand alone program, but deseigned to be used once to produce the desired results. However, the workflow can be followed and reporoduced. All of required data is described in comments above the code which imports it. 

VNP46A2 NTL data is imported and transformed into a raster format, and averaged and analysed in a variety of ways. Producing time series data, maps, and more. 
A minimal amount of ArcMap was also used in the analysis, which is described where appropriate in the comments.

This work makes heavy use of Suomi NPP VNP46A2 datasets was acquired from the Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System (LAADS) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), located in the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland (https://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/).
